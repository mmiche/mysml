\title{A list that contains data.frames, used in some code examples of mysml.}
\format{
orderedObsLs contains a list of data.frames for each of both prediction models, with 734 rows (20% of full sample size, which is 3670) and 4 columns:
\itemize{
  \item observed (binary outcome; 0 = no event observed, 1 = event observed).
  \item predicted (predicted probabilities, i.e., values between > 0 and < 1).
  \item ids (dataset row number or some other identifier).
  \item id (sequence of 1 to 734).
}

dcaLs contains two lists (names: tableDCA and plotDCA). tableDCA contains data.frames, each containing 16 columns:
\itemize{
  \item TN (true negatives).
  \item FP (false positives).
  \item FN (false negatives).
  \item TP (true positives).
  \item sens (sensitivity, recall, or true positive rate).
  \item spec (specificity or true negative rate).
  \item ppv (positive predictive value or precision).
  \item npv (negative predictive value).
  \item thrsh (threshold probability).
  \item FPwt (the value used to weigh FP).
  \item nbTreatAll (net benefit of the treat all curve).
  \item nbTreatNone (net benefit of treat none; always 0).
  \item nbModel (net benefit of the prediction model).
  \item deltaNB (difference between nbModel and TreatAll or between nbModel and TreatNone).
  \item model (name of the prediction model).
  \item rep (repetition of cross-validation).
}

dcaLs contains two lists (names: tableDCA and plotDCA). plotDCA contains data.frames, each containing 3 columns:
\itemize{
  \item label (names of decision strategies, e.g., Treat all).
  \item threshold (selected reasonable range of theshold probabilities).
  \item net_benefit (net benefit).
}

The last list element of test ('calibLs') is very similar to the first list element ('orderedObsLs').

\description{
This test list object has been produced with the predProbsLs output, which has been produced with the simulated dummyData.

Each element of the list is again a list:
