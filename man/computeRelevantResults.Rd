\title{Relevant results for a clinical prediction model.}
\usage{
computeRelevantResults(
  predictionOutputLs = NULL,
  dcaStartAtZero = TRUE,
  dcaReasonableThresholds = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictionOutputLs}{A list whose elements are data.frames, each data.frame containing a column with observed events (0 = no, 1 = yes) and a column with the predicted probabilities of observing the event.}

\item{dcaStartAtZero}{Boolean value. TRUE (default) if the x-axis of the decision curve plot shall include zero, else FALSE.}

\item{dcaReasonableThresholds}{Numeric vector with the selected reasonable range of threshold probabilities.}
}
\value{
a list with three lists as elements:
\enumerate{
\item orderedObsLs A list that contains data.frames (df), each df contains the column observed (= observed outcome, 0 = no, 1 = yes) and the column predicted (= predicted probabilities).
\item dcaLs Two lists, named tableDCA and plotDCA, respectively (see \strong{Examples}).
\item calibLs A list that contains data.frames (df), each df contains the predicted probabilities of all prediction models (column name is the prediction model, e.g., logreg) and the observed outcome (column name 'observed').
}
}
\description{
Compute results that are relevant for a clinical prediction model.
}
\examples{
# Use the predicted probabilities (output for several cross-validations
# of two prediction models, logistic regression and random forest), which
# are computed from using a simulated dummy dataset.
